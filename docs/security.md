# Security model

Infinite Loop is a developer tool that runs **on your machine** and can execute:

- Local agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, anything you register as a provider).
- Inline TypeScript and Python (Script nodes).
- Shell commands (Condition nodes with `kind: command`).
- Workflows queued by inbound webhooks.

That power means it should be treated like a local code execution surface, not a typical web app.

## Default network posture

Out of the box `server.ts` binds to `0.0.0.0` so the console is reachable from other machines on your LAN. This is convenient on a trusted home/office network, but **anyone who can reach your port can also run your workflows** — including the shell-condition and script nodes.

If you don't need LAN access:

```bash
HOST=127.0.0.1 bun run dev
```

## Headless / multi-user posture

Set `INFLOOP_API_TOKEN` to require a bearer token on every `/api/*` call:

```bash
INFLOOP_API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) bun run start
```

Caveats:

- The browser UI **stops working** for that server (the UI doesn't forward the token).
- Use this for Infinite Loop instances dedicated to serving agent / MCP traffic.
- The token is compared in constant time but is otherwise a plain shared secret — rotate it like a password.

## Webhooks

The unguessable `triggerId` in a webhook URL is the credential. There is **no HMAC signature verification** in the current build.

- Treat webhook URLs like passwords. Don't paste them in shared docs or screenshots.
- Rotate via the regenerate-id button in the Dispatch form.
- `INFLOOP_API_TOKEN` does **not** apply to webhook ingress — external services like GitHub can't carry custom auth headers.
- Signature verification (GitHub HMAC, Stripe signing) is planned; see [the roadmap](../README.md#status).

## Don't expose to the public internet

There is no rate limiting, no per-user auth, and no audit log. If you need a publicly reachable trigger surface, put Infinite Loop behind one of:

- A Cloudflare Tunnel with **Access policies** that gate inbound traffic.
- A Tailscale ACL-restricted host.
- A reverse proxy (Caddy / nginx) with HTTP auth and IP allow-lists.

Never punch a port mapping on your router straight to Infinite Loop.

## Workflow files are executable code

A `.workflow.json` file can:

- Run arbitrary shell commands via a Condition.
- Execute arbitrary TypeScript or Python via a Script node.
- Invoke any provider you have registered.

**Review every workflow you import or download before running it.** Treat them like you'd treat a Bash script from the internet.

The same applies to `providers/*.json`, `webhook-plugins/*.json`, and `triggers/*.json` — they all influence what Infinite Loop will execute or accept.

## Reporting security issues

Infinite Loop is pre-1.0 and currently has no formal disclosure channel. Open a GitHub issue for non-sensitive concerns; for anything that warrants private disclosure, contact the maintainer directly.

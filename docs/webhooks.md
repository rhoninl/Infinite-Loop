# Webhook guide

Open the **Dispatch** view (top-bar button, next to the workflow menu) to create, edit, and test webhook triggers visually. Each trigger gets a unique URL. When an HTTP POST hits it, InfLoop matches the trigger's predicates against the request, queues a workflow run with templated inputs, and returns `202 { queued, queueId, position }`.

## Creating a trigger

1. **Dispatch → + New trigger**.
2. Name it and pick the target workflow.
3. Pick a **plugin** that describes the webhook source:
   - **Generic** — any JSON POST. Predicates and input mappings are free-form `{{body.x.y.z}}` template strings.
   - **GitHub** — declares `push`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, and `pull_request` events; the form's field picker autocompletes from the event's schema.
   - Drop a JSON file in `webhook-plugins/` to add more (see [Adding a plugin](#adding-a-plugin)).
4. Configure **Match** predicates (AND-joined). For GitHub the `x-github-event` header check is implicit — pick the event in the form, and you only write predicates for body fields.
5. Map **Inputs** — each declared workflow input becomes a row; fill in a template string using the field picker.
6. **Save**, then copy the URL from the detail pane.

## Wiring up GitHub

InfLoop listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default. To reach it from `github.com`, expose your machine with a tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Then in your repo: **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Payload URL | `https://<your-tunnel>.trycloudflare.com/api/webhook/<id>` |
| Content type | `application/json` |
| Secret | (leave blank — the URL is the credential in v2) |
| Events | Pick specific events, or "Send everything" and filter in Dispatch |

## Test fire

Hit **Test** on any trigger row to open the test-fire modal. Edit a JSON payload (pre-filled from the plugin's example), set headers, and Send. You'll see the real webhook response (202, 204, 422, …) so you can debug predicates and input mapping without leaving the UI.

## Adding a plugin

Plugins are pure JSON. Create `webhook-plugins/<id>.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "stripe",
  "displayName": "Stripe",
  "eventHeader": "stripe-event-type",
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "checkout.session.completed",
      "displayName": "Checkout session completed",
      "fields": [
        { "path": "body.data.object.id",       "type": "string" },
        { "path": "body.data.object.amount",   "type": "number" },
        { "path": "body.data.object.customer", "type": "string" }
      ],
      "examplePayload": { "data": { "object": { "id": "cs_…", "amount": 5000 } } }
    }
  ]
}
```

Restart InfLoop. The plugin appears in the trigger form's plugin dropdown.

## Behavior reference

- Match succeeds → `202 { queued, queueId, position }`. Run is queued in memory.
- Match fails or plugin event-header mismatches → `204 No Content`.
- Unknown / disabled trigger id → `404 not-found`.
- Body > 1 MiB → `413 payload-too-large`.
- Queue at cap (100) → `503 queue-full` with `Retry-After: 30`.

## Security

The unguessable `triggerId` in the URL is the credential. There's no HMAC verification in v2 — **treat trigger URLs like passwords**; rotate via the regenerate-id button in the Dispatch form.

`INFLOOP_API_TOKEN` does **not** apply to webhook ingress (external services can't carry custom auth headers); it gates the management API only. See [security.md](security.md) for the full picture.

## Limitations

- Queued runs are lost on process restart (the webhook caller already received `202`; upstream services own retry).
- No service-specific signature verification (GitHub HMAC, Stripe signing) yet — planned as a follow-up.

## Storage

- `triggers/<id>.json` — one file per trigger.
- `webhook-plugins/<id>.json` — one file per plugin (Generic is built-in; you don't need to ship a file for it).

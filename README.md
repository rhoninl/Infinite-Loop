## What is Infinite Loop?

Infinite Loop is a **local visual canvas for orchestrating AI agents**. You compose workflows out of typed nodes — Agent, Loop, Branch, Parallel, Subworkflow, Judge, Script — and watch every token stream as the model generates it. Workflows are plain JSON files you can version in git, share with a teammate, and trigger from the UI, an MCP client, or a webhook.

## Why Infinite Loop

Without orchestration, agent work lives as bash wrappers and one-off transcripts. The pain shows up fast:

- "Loop until the tests pass" becomes a **brittle shell script** you can't debug.
- "Run three prompts and pick the best" becomes a **browser tab full of copy-paste**.
- An automation that should fire on a GitHub event ends up **running by hand**.
- Yesterday's successful run is **gone** — no transcript, no replay, no diff with today's run.

Infinite Loop fills that gap with one local app: **a canvas to compose**, **a live console to watch**, **persisted history to replay**, and **three triggering surfaces** (UI / MCP / webhook) so workflows can fire from wherever the work originates.

## Quickstart

**Requirements:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3. The default Claude provider needs the [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) on your `PATH` (override with `INFLOOP_CLAUDE_BIN`). Other providers — Codex, Hermes, your own HTTP service — work too; see [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhoninl/Infinite-Loop.git
cd Infinite-Loop
bun install
bun run dev
```

**First run:**

1. Open <http://localhost:3000>.
2. The starter workflow loads automatically.
3. Click an **Agent** node and edit its `prompt` and `cwd` in the right panel.
4. Hit **Run** in the top bar.
5. Watch streaming tokens appear live in the right panel as the agent generates them.

Other scripts: `bun run test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`, `bun run start`.

## Core concepts

A workflow is a directed graph of typed nodes. Each node writes outputs into a flat scope keyed by node id; downstream nodes reference them with `{{node-id.field}}` templating.

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | Runs an agent through a provider (Claude, Codex, Hermes, your own). |
| **Loop** | Repeats its body until a `Condition` says stop, capped by `maxIterations`. |
| **Condition** | `sentinel` (text match), `command` (shell exit code), or `judge` (a second agent grades). |
| **Branch** | `lhs op rhs` predicate routing to `true` / `false` / `error`. |
| **Parallel** | Fans children out — `wait-all`, `race`, or `quorum:N`. |
| **Subworkflow** | Calls another workflow as a single step with isolated inputs and outputs. |
| **Judge** | Reads N candidates and picks a winner with structured scoring. |
| **Script** | Inline TypeScript (Bun) or Python (`python3`) with typed named inputs. |
| **Start / End** | Entry and exit. Start declares the workflow's caller-supplied `inputs`. |

Full reference (handles, output keys, JSON schema): [docs/workflow-format.md](docs/workflow-format.md).

### Bring your own agent runner

Agent nodes are **provider-agnostic**. Three flavors ship today:

- **CLI providers** — `claude`, `codex`, or any other binary you wrap with a JSON manifest. Token streaming is parsed live for Claude's `stream-json` format.
- **HTTP providers — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint** including **Hermes**, **OpenRouter**, and **vLLM**. The manifest declares a base URL, auth (env-var or local-only inline token), and optional `profilesEndpoint` so Infinite Loop can **live-discover the models** the server exposes.
- **Local Hermes connections** — manage them visually through the in-app Connections modal. Each connection produces one selectable provider per port/profile, grouped under its own palette section. Secrets live in gitignored `*.hermes.local.json` files.

Drop a new manifest into `providers/` and the palette picks it up. Full format: [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

### See it run

A real run logged as plain text:

```
run_started     Loop until condition
node_started    loop-1
node_started    agent-1
agent-1 │ All frontend pages render cleanly. Now
agent-1 │ let me SSH to the edge node and check USB devices…
node_finished   agent-1 → next
node_started    cond-1
condition_checked  cond-1 met:Y matched at index 6
node_finished   cond-1 → met
run_finished    succeeded
```

## Examples — what you can build

- **Iterate until tests pass.** Loop an agent over a codebase with a `command` condition running `pytest -q`. Stops the moment **ground truth** says done.
- **Multi-agent debate.** Fan three prompts (idiomatic, contrarian, conservative) out to Claude in parallel; let a Judge node read all three and **pick a winner**. The shipped **Team** preset does exactly this — see `workflows/library/team.json`.
- **Self-grading drafts.** One agent drafts, a second grades against a rubric, **loop until the grade clears a threshold**.
- **GitHub-driven review.** A webhook trigger on `pull_request: opened` queues a review workflow that **posts a comment back**.
- **Agents calling Infinite Loop.** Expose your workflows as MCP tools so Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, or Zed can call them by name — **discovery for free**.

## How Infinite Loop is different

| Tool | Sweet spot | Where Infinite Loop fits |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code / Codex** | A great single-agent session | Infinite Loop coordinates **repeatable, multi-step, multi-agent** workflows on top of them |
| **n8n / Zapier** | SaaS automation between hosted apps | Infinite Loop is **local-first** and focused on **agent runners**, scripts, and CLIs |
| **LangGraph** | Code-defined agent graphs in Python | Infinite Loop is **visual, inspectable, and replayable** — faster to tweak without editing graph code |
| **Dify / Flowise** | LLM apps and chatbot flows | Infinite Loop targets **developer workflows** — CLIs, MCP, webhooks, filesystem checks |
| **OpenHands** | Autonomous coding tasks | Infinite Loop focuses on **orchestration, branching, replay, and external triggers** |

## Trigger surfaces

Three ways to start a workflow:

1. **Canvas** — click Run in the top bar. If the workflow declares inputs, a modal collects them.
2. **MCP** — every saved workflow is exposed as a tool at `POST /api/mcp`. Workflow tools enqueue (non-blocking) and return `{ queueId, position }`; poll with `infinite_loop_get_run_status`. Full guide: [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).
3. **Webhook** — wire up triggers visually in the Dispatch view. Generic JSON or GitHub events out of the box; drop a JSON file in `webhook-plugins/` to add more. Full guide: [docs/webhooks.md](docs/webhooks.md).

> The engine runs **one workflow at a time**. Additional MCP calls and webhook hits queue in FIFO order (cap 100); the `/queue` page shows pending items with per-item cancel.

## Security model

Infinite Loop can run **local agent CLIs, inline TypeScript and Python, and shell commands** on your machine. Treat workflows as executable code, and treat the server as a local code-execution surface.

- **Default bind is `0.0.0.0`** for LAN convenience. Use `HOST=127.0.0.1` if you don't need it.
- **`INFLOOP_API_TOKEN`** gates the management/MCP API with a bearer token; setting it disables the browser UI (use for headless servers).
- **Webhook URLs are credentials.** The unguessable `triggerId` in the URL is the only auth — treat URLs like passwords and rotate via the Dispatch UI.
- **Workflow JSON files are executable code.** Review every workflow you import or download before running it. The same goes for files in `providers/`, `webhook-plugins/`, and `triggers/`.
- **Do not expose Infinite Loop directly to the public internet.** No rate limiting, no per-user auth, no audit log yet. Put it behind a Cloudflare Tunnel with Access policies, a Tailscale ACL, or a reverse proxy with HTTP auth.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. The codebase is small — a good way in is to read the original design at [`specs/workflow-dag-design.md`](specs/workflow-dag-design.md) and the engine at [`lib/server/workflow-engine.ts`](lib/server/workflow-engine.ts).
